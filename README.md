# Reference Implementation for *Efficient object location determination and error analysis based on barycentric coordinates* and *A barycentric coordinates-based visualization framework for movement of microscopic organisms*

This repository contains our reference implementation for the paper *Efficient object location determination and error analysis based on barycentric coordinates* and our manuscript *A barycentric coordinates-based visualization framework for movement of microscopic organisms*.

## Dependencies

The provided implementation requires the following external software:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
    - Tested with v16.11.30.

## Running the Sample

### Building with Visual Studio

The solution can be opened in Visual Studio and built simply by selecting the desired build configuration (we recommend using a `Release` build for optimal performance). No additional steps are required.

### Running the Program

In Visual Studio, the program can be started simply using the `Start Without Debugging` option.
